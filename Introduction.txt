This repository is for the internet and web programming project of Dhrubanka Dutta. 
The project is a color palette generator that takes an image as an input and returns the color samples and hex codes of the colors.
The major colours of the image are collected using k-means clustering and then the resultant colors are displayed to the user in a new page
